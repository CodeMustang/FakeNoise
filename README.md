# FakeNoise
[Android Project] Android project used for entertainment.

I've been trying to work over the past year on this project , I think it's almost done (in proportion of 90%).

Basically it's an app that allows you to record audio, save some contacts from your agenda withing your app (or add new ones), and what I'm struggling with now is to play the certain audio file selected for that contact to play whenever he/she is calling you.
